## TP Snakemake
The goal of this project is the initiation to a workflow language Snakemake and the discovery of its interest compared to the construction of a rudimentary workflow built in bash. 

The project is based on the construction of a workflow in Snakemake allowing to reproduce the analysis steps conducted in the ATACseq project from the quality control of the fastq.gz sequences to the identification of regions of accessibility to the DNA in 2 biological conditions considered.
